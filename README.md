## RTL Design Collection Exploration

### Verilog Files Directory

```bash
# Navigate to RTL design collection
cd ../verilog_files/
```

### Comprehensive Design Collection

The verilog_files directory contains an extensive collection of RTL designs and testbenches covering fundamental to advanced digital logic concepts:

**Combinational Logic Designs:**
- `good_mux.v`, `bad_mux.v` - Multiplexer implementations (good vs bad practices)
- `demux_generate.v` - Demultiplexer designs
- `fa.v` - Full adder implementation
- `rca.v` - Ripple carry adder

**Sequential Logic Designs:**
- `dff_async_set.v` - D flip-flop with asynchronous set
- `dff_asyncres_syncres.v` - D flip-flop with dual reset modes
- `dff_const1.v` through `dff_const5.v` - Constant optimization examples

**Advanced System Modules:**
- `counter_opt.v`, `good_counter.v` - Counter implementations
- `ripple_counter.v`, `up_dn_cntr.v` - Various counter types
- `multiple_modules.v` - Hierarchical design examples

**Corresponding Testbenches:**
- Each design has an associated testbench (`tb_*.v`) for comprehensive verification
- Examples: `tb_good_mux.v`, `tb_dff_asyncres_syncres.v`, etc.

## Simulation Workflow Implementation

### Good MUX Design Simulation

The practical simulation exercise focused on the `good_mux.v` design as a representative example.

### Initial Simulation Attempt

```bash
# Attempt to compile design and testbench
vsduser@vsdsquadron:~/vsdflow/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files$ iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v
```

### Tool Installation Requirement

The initial attempt revealed that Icarus Verilog needed to be installed:

```
Command 'iverilog' not found, did you mean:

command 'iverilog' from deb iverilog

Try: sudo apt install <deb name>
```

### Successful Simulation Execution

After installing iverilog (as implied by the PDF screenshots showing successful simulation), the compilation and simulation proceeded:

```bash
# Compilation (after iverilog installation)
iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v

# Simulation execution  
./a.out
VCD info: dumpfile tb_good_mux.vcd opened for output.
```

![Simulation Process](screenshots/06_simulation_workflow.png)

### Good MUX RTL Design Analysis

Based on the code shown in the PDF screenshots, the `good_mux.v` design implements a 2:1 multiplexer:

```verilog
module good_mux (input i0, input i1, input sel, output reg y);
    always @ (*)
    begin
        if (sel)
            y <= i1;
        else  
            y <= i0;
    end
endmodule
```

### Testbench Implementation Analysis

The `tb_good_mux.v` testbench provides comprehensive stimulus:

```verilog
`timescale 1ns / 1ps

module tb_good_mux;
    // Inputs
    reg i0, i1, sel;
    // Outputs  
    wire y;
    
    // Instantiate the Unit Under Test (UUT)
    good_mux uut (
        .sel(sel),
        .i0(i0), 
        .i1(i1),
        .y(y)
    );
    
    initial begin
        $dumpfile("tb_good_mux.vcd");
        $dumpvars(0, tb_good_mux);
        
        // Initialize Inputs
        sel = 0;
        i0 = 0;
        i1 = 0;
        #300 $finish;
    end
    
    always #75 sel = ~sel;   // Toggle select every 75ns
    always #10 i0 = ~i0;    // Toggle i0 every 10ns  
    always #55 i1 = ~i1;    // Toggle i1 every 55ns
endmodule
```

## GTKWave Waveform Analysis

### Waveform Viewing

```bash
# Launch GTKWave for waveform analysis
gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd
```

### Waveform Analysis Results

The GTKWave screenshots from the PDF show successful waveform generation with the following observations:

**Signal Behavior:**
- **i0**: Toggles every 10ns as specified
- **i1**: Toggles every 55ns as specified  
- **sel**: Toggles every 75ns as specified
- **y**: Correctly follows multiplexer logic (y = sel ? i1 : i0)

**Timing Verification:**
- Simulation runs from 0 to 300ns as programmed
- All signal transitions occur at expected time intervals
- Multiplexer functionality verified across all input combinations

### Functional Verification Results

The waveform analysis confirms correct multiplexer operation:
- When sel = 0: Output y follows input i0
- When sel = 1: Output y follows input i1
- No glitches or timing violations observed
- Clean digital signal transitions throughout simulation
